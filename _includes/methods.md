<p style="text-align: justify;">
Okay, fellow time travelers, I’m about to let you in on a little secret — how we actually managed to analyze decades of movie history! First, I used powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)—think of them as genius AIs that have read everything and can chat like a super-smart friend—to zip through tons of plot summaries and extract key themes. It’s like having a superpower to analyze movies in seconds!. Then came LDA, which grouped words into themes like ‘action’ or ‘romance,’ revealing the names, adjectives, and vibes of each decade.

Next, Pearson correlation worked its magic by linking movie themes to historical events—like connecting mentions of ‘war’ in the 1940s to World War II. Cool, right? I also mapped words into coordinates with word embeddings, so I could see connections—like how ‘adventure’ and ‘exploration’ go hand in hand.

Finally, K-Means clustering swooped in to group movies into neat little clusters, whether they were pulse-pounding action flicks or heart-wrenching dramas. And voilà! That’s how we pieced together the ultimate cinematic time machine. Now you’re in on the secret!
