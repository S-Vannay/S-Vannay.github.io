<h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 10s: The Birth of Cinema</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the 1910s, cinema was still finding its feet, shaped by a world on the brink of dramatic change. Early films often revolved around clear-cut battles between good and evil, but this era also started to introduce more human and nuanced characters. Let’s meet two unforgettable figures who embody this pivotal time:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Adelaide "Addie" LaRue is ahead of her time, a spirited young woman carving out a place for herself in a world that doesn’t expect much from her. With her sharp wit and unshakable resilience, she’s an early example of the "strong woman" archetype—though her strength is shown through cleverness and charm rather than sheer force.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The second figure is Bert Fletcher. He is the lovable rogue with a knack for getting into and out of trouble. Once a door-to-door salesman, Bert finds himself unexpectedly thrown into roles ranging from handyman to accidental hero. His adventurous spirit and quick thinking make him the perfect reflection of a rapidly changing society in the early 20th century.

        <h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 20s: The Roaring Twenties</em></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Ah, the 1920s ! They were a time of lavish excess, rebellion, and social transformation. Jazz, flappers, and the glamorous art deco movement painted the backdrop, while cinema began to tackle bolder, more complex themes. Two characters, but with the same name, from this era capture the dizzying mix of ambition, risk, and allure.

Let me introduce you the first Ren Dumont, a treasure hunter. This Ren is the charismatic adventurer who thrives on both the physical and emotional thrill of his escapades. Driven by a fierce desire to uncover his family’s hidden past, he’s witty, daring, and always just one step ahead of danger. His globe-trotting treasure hunts mirror the expanding reach of cinema during this decade.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The second Ren Dumont is actually a very different version of the previous one...A different side of Ren emerges as an engineer—practical, forward-thinking, and deeply committed to progress. In a world rapidly industrializing, Ren must confront both external challenges and his own inner doubts, representing the push toward a technological future in the midst of a changing world.
</p>

<!--The 30s -->
<h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 30s: Golden Dreams and Great Escapes</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By the 1930s, Hollywood had cemented its position as the beating heart of cinema. Larger-than-life characters, escapism, and heartfelt romance reflected society's yearning for hope during the Great Depression. Here are two figures who encapsulate the era’s spirit.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Tough as nails and sharp as a tack, Echo is a hardboiled detective with a razor-sharp mind and a drive for justice. Behind her tough exterior, she carries the weight of personal loss, adding complexity to her role as a seeker of truth. Echo embodies the era’s blend of strength and vulnerability, chasing down criminals while dealing with her own emotional battles.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Now, meet a completely different character named Axel "Gramps" Jensen. Axel is the rugged, world-weary mountain man, offering wisdom and strength to a group of adventurers who cross his path. His love for nature and quiet independence make him a perfect symbol for an era that often explored man’s relationship with the wilderness. Despite his gruffness, Axel reveals a tenderness that highlights the complexity of his character.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The 1940s were shaped by the chaos and tragedy of the Second World War, which left an indelible mark on both the world and the movies. Cinema turned to stories of heroism, loss, and patriotism, reflecting the collective desire for hope amidst the global turmoil. Here are two characters who represent this time of resilience and uncertainty:

As the previous decade, detectives were still present in cinema, but have evolved a little bit. Let me introduce you Ethan Blackwood, a former medic turned private investigator.

His work is driven by a determination to solve complex cases, but his internal struggles reflect the broader experience of recovery and survival after WWII.

<!--The 50s -->
<h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 50s: Post-War Glamour</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The 1950s were all about contrasts. On one hand, Hollywood was shining bright, with stars becoming global icons of beauty and style. On the other, society was shaking off the rigidity of the pre-war years, with a wave of rebellion and change. Movies began to reflect these shifts, moving away from simple heroes and villains to explore more complex, layered characters. Women, in particular, were no longer just the damsels in distress—they became bold, multifaceted individuals, just like Finley and Alexandra "Alex" Thompson.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finley, a diplomat, grew up in a small town, surrounded by stories of bravery and loss. After surviving a Civil War prison camp, he developed a sharp wit and a loyal heart. Now 35, Finley uses their military know-how and a touch of magic as a diplomat and strategist in a kingdom full of political intrigue. Beneath the sarcasm and quick jokes, Finley fights for justice and the vulnerable, proving that even in the toughest times, humor and heart can go hand in hand.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Alex is a 32-year-old British intelligence officer with a deep sense of duty, raised by parents who fought in the French Resistance. As an operative for the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), Alex is the epitome of grace under pressure, handling covert missions with precision and skill. While she’s tough and independent, her partnership with fellow agent Tony Fraser reveals a softer, more caring side. Alex proves that even in the world of espionage, loyalty and love can be just as important as duty.

The 1970s were defined by a sense of rebellion and self-discovery. The world was changing, and so were the characters of the decade.

A brooding, complex figure, Axel is fiercely independent but carries a deep sense of loyalty to those he trusts.
