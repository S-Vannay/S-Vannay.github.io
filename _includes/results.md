<h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 10s: The Birth of Cinema</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the 1910s, cinema was evolving alongside a rapidly changing world. Early films often focused on clear-cut tales of good versus evil, but this era also explored more complex, human characters. Two figures stand out as reflections of these shifting themes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Adelaide "Addie" LaRue is a clever, resilient young woman challenging societal expectations. She embodies an early version of the "strong woman" archetype, relying on wit and charm rather than brute strength. Bert Fletcher, a lovable rogue and former door-to-door salesman, becomes an accidental hero. His adventurous spirit and quick thinking reflect the adaptability required in a world in turmoil.

These characters tie into the historical themes of their era. The heatmap reveals that war, revolution, and class struggles were significant cinematic influences. Addie’s resilience speaks to the fight against social barriers, while Bert’s resourcefulness mirrors the need to adapt during upheaval. Movies of the 1910s weren’t just entertainment—they were a mirror of a world in flux, with Addie and Bert symbolizing the struggles and spirit of their time.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Ah, the 1920s ! They were a time of lavish excess, rebellion, and social transformation. Jazz, flappers, and the glamorous art deco movement painted the backdrop, while cinema began to tackle bolder, more complex themes. Two characters, but with the same name, from this era capture the dizzying mix of ambition, risk, and allure.

<h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 30s: Golden Dreams and Great Escapes</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By the 1930s, Hollywood had cemented its position as the beating heart of cinema. Larger-than-life characters, escapism, and heartfelt romance reflected society's yearning for hope during the Great Depression. Here are two figures who encapsulate the era’s spirit.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

<!--The 50s -->
<h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 50s: Post-War Glamour</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The 1950s were all about contrasts. On one hand, Hollywood was shining bright, with stars becoming global icons of beauty and style. On the other, society was shaking off the rigidity of the pre-war years, with a wave of rebellion and change. Movies began to reflect these shifts, moving away from simple heroes and villains to explore more complex, layered characters. Women, in particular, were no longer just the damsels in distress—they became bold, multifaceted individuals, just like Finley and Alexandra "Alex" Thompson.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finley, a diplomat, grew up in a small town, surrounded by stories of bravery and loss. After surviving a Civil War prison camp, he developed a sharp wit and a loyal heart. Now 35, Finley uses their military know-how and a touch of magic as a diplomat and strategist in a kingdom full of political intrigue. Beneath the sarcasm and quick jokes, Finley fights for justice and the vulnerable, proving that even in the toughest times, humor and heart can go hand in hand.

While she’s tough and independent, her partnership with fellow agent Tony Fraser reveals a softer, more caring side. Alex proves that even in the world of espionage, loyalty and love can be just as important as duty.

A brooding, complex figure, Axel is fiercely independent but carries a deep sense of loyalty to those he trusts.
