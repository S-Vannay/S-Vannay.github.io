<h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 10s: The Birth of Cinema</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Greetings, fellow time travelers! As we step into the 1910s, let me introduce you to two iconic figures who dominated this era of silent films. These characters reflect the stories audiences couldn’t get enough of, shaped by a world on the brink of transformation. Meet our two stars of the decade! 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, Meet Adelaide "Addie" LaRue, a 25-year-old French whirlwind who's basically a human embodiment of "I do what I want." Born into a poor family in the French countryside, she grew up determined to prove that no, society's limited opportunities for women wouldn't hold her back (take that, patriarchy!). If you have the opportunity to meet her, be careful, because Addi's personality is a delightful cocktail of contradictions. Cunning and manipulative? Oh yeah, she’ll charm her way to the top. Determined and resourceful? Absolutely. She's got a whole toolbox of "I’ll get what I want" strategies. Independent and strong-willed? You bet. She’ll never ask for permission, only forgiveness. Emotionally vulnerable? Of course. Under all that sass, she’s got a soft spot for the underdogs (and probably a few too many existential crises).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Now, meet Bert Fletcher, a 35-year-old former salesman turned street-smart handyman. Once lost in his own career, Bert now spends his days fixing things (often things that weren’t broken) and picking pockets with his quick wit and charm. A lovable rogue with a heart of gold, he’s always ready for an adventure, especially if it involves pranks or a clever con. Whether he’s navigating chaos or talking his way out of sticky situations, Bert’s resourceful and quick on his feet. Though he’s a troublemaker by nature, he’s got a soft spot for the underdog and always tries to do the right thing, even if it means making more mess than he intended. When he’s not swindling people or fixing leaky faucets, Bert’s tinkering with his collection of old clockwork gadgets in his hidden workshop. A loner at heart, he’s always up for a wild ride, and no matter what, you can count on one thing: a good time... and probably an empty wallet.

        <h2 style="color: #960018;"><em>The 20s: The Roaring Twenties</em></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Ah, the 1920s—an era of jazz, gin, and flappers who threw convention to the wind. The world was changing, and the streets were buzzing with rebellion, glamour, and daring adventures. It was a time when everyone was either dancing the Charleston or plotting their next big score, and the people who ruled this new age of possibility were as vibrant as the neon lights of the city. But behind all the glitz and glamour, there were those who made their own rules and carved their own paths. Meet two such characters.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Meet Ren Dumont, a 28-year-old treasure hunter and sailor whose charm and quick wit are matched only by his ambition. With a natural ability to talk his way out of trouble, Ren navigates life with a resourcefulness that keeps him one step ahead of danger. Always in search of the next big opportunity, he’s driven by the thrill of discovery and the hope of uncovering his family's lost treasure. Ren’s not afraid to take risks, often diving into complex situations where politics and intrigue mix. Despite his roguish tendencies, he’s got a soft spot for the underdog and a deep sense of loyalty to those he cares about. When he's not chasing treasure or brokering deals, Ren spends his time collecting rare trinkets, particularly antique pocket watches, which he believes bring him good luck.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Actually, another Ren Dumont with the same was also very common in the 20s, but is a very different version of the previous Ren...He's a rising star in the world of engineering, whose ambition is as sharp as his mind. Born into a lower-middle-class family, Ren’s humble beginnings fueled his drive to escape the limitations of his past. Fiercely dedicated to his craft, he’s known for his innovative thinking and ability to tackle complex problems with ease, all while navigating the high-stakes world of prestigious projects and deadlines. This Ren is a man of contradictions: outwardly confident, but secretly haunted by insecurities rooted in his childhood. His intense ambition often leads him to sacrifice personal connections in pursuit of success, constantly seeking validation and recognition from his peers. When he’s not buried in work, Ren indulges in his love for collecting antique clocks, which symbolize his desire for precision and control. Despite his achievements, he struggles with forming meaningful relationships, afraid that vulnerability might threaten his hard-earned position in the elite circles he’s worked so hard to enter.

        The most common name we found in our data? John. This reflects the many everyday heroes and soldiers of the time—strong, resilient, and determined. The adjective that stood out most was young, symbolizing the fresh faces heading to war and the optimism of a new generation. And what were the themes shaping these characters? Hero, war, science, fashion, and film. These themes reflect the heart of the 1940s: bravery in the face of global conflict, the technological advances brought on by the war, the rise of new fashion trends, and the golden age of cinema that kept spirits high during dark time.
