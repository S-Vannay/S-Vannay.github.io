Next up, the genres that define our cinematic journey. Drama, comedy, action, horror — each genre offers a lens into the emotions and themes of its time. But which ones defined each era? Was the 80s dominated by action-packed thrillers, or did romance and drama steal the show? Spoiler alert: drama and comedy were the crowd favorites of the decade! Dive into the graph to explore the highs and lows of genre trends through the years.

Finally, let’s tackle a pressing question: gender representation.
Who’s been taking the lead in cinematic adventures? Over the decades, has the spotlight shifted from damsels in distress to sword-wielding heroines? Sadly, the data tells a more sobering story. Gender representation still has a long way to go, as you’ll see in the graph. Play around with the trends to uncover how the roles of men and women have evolved—or stayed stagnant—over time.
